# Scout DB

An internal tool for book scouts, built for gathering and reporting information to clients. Built with React, Express, Mongoose, MUI, React Router, React Query, react-hook-forms, and Yup.

### What is this?

Scout DB is a prototype of an internal database and reporting tool built for book scouts and their clients.

### What is the problem?

Scouts gather large amounts of information and report it to clients. Often this reporting is done via private local databases, email, phone, and pdfs. This is inefficient and communication can be haphazard or sporadic.
What is the solution?

Scout DB offers a streamlined way for book scouts to interact with their database, input information, track titles, and report to clients. For clients, it provides an online portal where large swaths of information can be easily managed, referenced, and highlighted.

### Ok, but what is a book scout?

A book scout helps international publishers, literary agents, and film production companies find new and worthwhile books to acquire for publication or adaptation. They may work independently or for a scouting agency and are often experts in a specific genre or market. They read widely, stay up-to-date on industry trends, and have a keen eye for identifying potential bestsellers or overlooked gems. They often have extensive contacts within the publishing industry and can help match books with the right publisher or production company.
