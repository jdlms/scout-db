# Scout DB

An internal tool for book scouts, built for gathering and reporting information to clients. Built with React, Express, Mongoose, MUI, React Router, React Query, react-hook-forms, and Yup.

### What's this?

Scout DB is a prototype of an internal database and reporting tool built for book scouts and their clients.

### What's the problem?

Scouts gather large amounts of information and report it to clients. Often this reporting is done via private local databases, email, phone, and pdfs. This is inefficient and communication can be haphazard or sporadic.

### What's the solution?

Scout DB offers a streamlined way for book scouts to interact with their database, input information, track titles, and report to clients. For clients, it provides an online portal where large swaths of information can be easily managed, referenced, and highlighted.

### Ok, but what is a book scout?

A book scout helps international publishers, literary agents, and film production companies find new and worthwhile books to acquire for translation or adaptation. They may work independently or in an agency and are often experts in a specific genre or market. They read widely and have a keen eye for identifying potential bestsellers or overlooked gems. Their job is matching books with the right publisher or production company.
